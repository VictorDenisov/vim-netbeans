Last update: February 3, 2013

DESCRIPTION
-----------

This is an implementation of the vim netbeans protocol
<http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/netbeans.html>.

LIMITATIONS
-----------

setModTime is not implemented yet due to lack of information about time format
in vim-netbeans protocol.

Functions which are marked as not implemented in vim-netbeans documentation are
not implemented.

Function invocation hangs if connection with Vim was lost.
